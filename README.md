## [snekManual.py]
Manual mode with an experimental fitness function (reward motion aligned to proper vector). (Did not make it to the final build.)

## [snek.py]
NEAT Genetic Learning running 50 snakes/gen. It is common trivia that all a snake knows is its velocity in 2D space and the vector it to joining nearest snack. 
They keep killing themselves right when they turn 25 [see footnote]. At this point I'm open to the interpretation that they harnessed The Truth and now preach a life lesson.

## [Other stuff]
Configurations for the genetic evolution including activation function, custom mutative settings, and other stuff that made me yawn so hard my jaw hurt.

### Footnote
It's on my TODO.
