the snakse are coming

## [snekManual.py]
Manual mode with an experimental fitness function (reward motion aligned to proper vector). (Did not make it to the final build.)

## [Other stuff]
Configurations for the genetic evolution including activation function, custom mutative settings, and other stuff that made me yawn so hard my jaw hurt.
